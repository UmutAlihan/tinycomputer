//! The shaper: one reasoning-model pass that turns what a finished task read
//! into the answer its caller asked for.
//!
//! A flow's `read`, `extract`, and `pick` steps save what they find as
//! variables, and a finished task returns them as raw records: whatever
//! text the screen showed, with its duplicates, its chrome, and its order.
//! A caller that asked for an [`TaskOutput`] gets one more step: the goal,
//! the instructions, the schema, and the records go to a reasoning model,
//! which answers with one JSON object. That object is checked against the
//! schema ([`schema::violations`]); a value that fails is sent back with what
//! is wrong, up to [`REPAIRS`] times, so what reaches the caller always has
//! the shape it asked for.
//!
//! The shaper never acts and sees no screen: only the records, with every
//! fact value already redacted by the task controller, wrapped as untrusted
//! data. It may only select, clean, reorder, and restructure what they hold;
//! it is told never to invent a value.
