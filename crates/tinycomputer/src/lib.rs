//! Native desktop automation as an installable `TinyBus` module.
//!
//! tinycomputer wraps the [`agent-desktop`] engine — accessibility-tree
//! observation and interaction for macOS, Windows, and Linux — and serves it
//! over `TinyBus` beside browser automation and a task API — eighty typed
//! members in all, listed with one-line summaries by
//! [`tinycomputer_bus::catalogue`]. A host loads the compiled `cdylib`, and
//! an agent behind that host gets structured access to any running
//! application and to Chrome: no screenshots to interpret, no pixel
//! matching.
//!
//! [`agent-desktop`]: https://github.com/lahfir/agent-desktop
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! This is the module crate of the workspace. It holds no behavior of its own:
//!
//! - [`tinycomputer_bus`] — the wire contract. Member names, request payloads,
//!   the response envelope, and the contract version, with no transport, no
//!   engine, and no behavior. A host that only makes calls depends on that
//!   crate alone.
//! - `tinycomputer-desktop` — [`Desktop`], the agent-desktop adapter, with one
//!   method per member, and the crate-wide [`Error`].
//! - `tinycomputer-engine` — the Jev runtime behind `ResolveIntent`, `RunGoal`,
//!   and `RunFlow`.
//! - `tinycomputer` — this crate. `src/tinybus_module/` adapts the adapter and
//!   the engine to the bus and exports the module descriptor, embedded
//!   manifest, and initialization entrypoint, built as both an `rlib` and the
//!   `cdylib` the loader consumes.
//!
//! Every public item is re-exported from here — including all of
//! [`tinycomputer_bus`] — so downstream users have one predictable surface and
//! `tinycomputer::SnapshotRequest` is the *same type* as
//! `tinycomputer_bus::SnapshotRequest`, not a structural twin.
//!
//! # The model: observe, then act on what you observed
//!
//! A snapshot walks an application's accessibility tree and hands back a
//! compact description in which every element carries a *ref* — a qualified
//! handle like `@s8f3k2p9:e1`. Interaction members take those refs. They do not
//! take coordinates, and they do not take selectors evaluated fresh at click
//! time.
//!
//! That indirection is the whole design. A ref is bound to the snapshot it came
//! from, so acting on one either reaches the element that was described or
//! fails with `STALE_REF` and asks for a fresh snapshot. What it will not do is
//! click whatever has since moved into that position.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use tinycomputer::{Desktop, FindRequest, RefRequest};
//!
//! let desktop = Desktop::new();
//!
//! let found = desktop.find(FindRequest {
//!     app: Some("Safari".to_owned()),
//!     role: Some("button".to_owned()),
//!     name: Some("Save".to_owned()),
//!     first: true,
//!     ..FindRequest::default()
//! });
//!
//! if found.ok {
//!     let reply = desktop.click(RefRequest::new("@s8f3k2p9:e1"));
//!     assert_eq!(reply.command, "click");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Headless by default
//!
//! A ref action goes through the platform's accessibility API, not through
//! synthesized input, so it does not steal focus, move the cursor, or touch the
//! pasteboard as a side effect. A run can proceed while someone else is using
//! the machine. [`Desktop::with_headed`] relaxes that for the interactions that
//! genuinely need a real cursor, and the [`input`](tinycomputer_bus::input)
//! members bypass it entirely — both on purpose, and both the exception.
//!
//! # Errors are replies, not failures
//!
//! Every command method returns a [`DesktopResponse`] and never a `Result`. A
//! stale ref, a missing permission, an ambiguous application name — these carry
//! codes, suggestions, and recovery hints a caller can branch on, and flattening
//! them into an error string would throw that away. [`Error`] is reserved for
//! the module failing to start a command at all. See
//! [`tinycomputer_bus::envelope`] for the full reasoning.
//!
//! # Platform support
//!
//! macOS and Windows have full accessibility backends. Linux builds, loads, and
//! answers, but implements no surfaces yet: every observation there fails with
//! `PLATFORM_NOT_SUPPORTED` and lists the surfaces it does support, which is
//! none. That is inherited from the vendored engine and will follow it.
