//! The browser members' bus identity: where they are served, and one constant
//! per member, in dispatch order.
//!
//! A `TinyBus` module exports one interface at one object path, so the
//! browser members are served on the module's interface beside the desktop
//! and task members, exactly as [`crate::agent::names`] are. Each carries a
//! `Browser` prefix: several (`Snapshot`, `Screenshot`) would otherwise
//! collide with a desktop member of a different shape, and a prefix on every
//! one of them keeps the family obvious to a model reading a member list.
//!
//! Nothing here is a string literal at a call site. A host names a member
//! through [`methods`], so a rename is a compile error in every consumer
//! rather than a runtime "unknown method". [`METHODS`] also appears, in the
//! same order, at the end of [`crate::names::METHODS`], and `crates/tinycomputer`
//! asserts its dispatch table against that list.
//!
//! Every member takes one JSON object and returns a [`crate::DesktopResponse`],
//! the same envelope the desktop members use; a failure carries one of the
//! codes in [`crate::browser::errors`].
