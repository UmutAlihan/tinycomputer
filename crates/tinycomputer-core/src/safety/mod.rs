//! What an action would commit to, and whether a page is asking for payment.
//!
//! Two deterministic checks every surface runs before it acts, independently
//! of anything a model decided:
//!
//! - [`consequence`] classifies a control by its label. A payment is never
//!   made on its own — it is stopped at, or held for approval; an irreversible action (send, delete, publish, confirm a
//!   booking) needs explicit approval; everything else proceeds. Stepping
//!   through a booking — "Book", "Select", "Continue" — is deliberately
//!   *reversible*: those lead to further forms, and the payment check stops
//!   the run before anything is charged.
//! - [`payment_evidence`] looks at the page itself — card fields, `cc-*`
//!   autocomplete attributes, a checkout URL with a pay button — so a payment
//!   step is caught even when its button says only "Continue".
//! - [`screen_payment_evidence`] builds `payment_evidence`'s inputs from a
//!   surface-agnostic [`Screen`](crate::surface::Screen), so every surface's
//!   destructive-click gate can apply the same page-level check.
