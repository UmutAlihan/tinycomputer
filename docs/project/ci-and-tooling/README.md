# .github/ and root configuration

This page covers continuous integration, the release workflow, the coverage
script, the pull request and issue templates, and the root configuration
files that shape every build: `Cargo.toml`, `deny.toml`, and `.env.example`.

## The four contract commands

CI runs exactly these, from the repository root, and a green local run should
mean a green CI run:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo build --all-targets --all-features
cargo test --all-features
```

## .github/workflows/ci.yml

Runs on every push and pull request, with in-progress runs on the same ref
cancelled automatically. Five jobs, all on `ubuntu-latest`, all checking out
submodules recursively:

| Job | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `rust` | formatting, clippy (`-D warnings`), build, `cargo test --all-features`, `cargo test` (default features), runs `cargo run -p tinycomputer-examples --bin basic` to catch a compiled-but-broken example, asserts `tinycomputer-bus` pulls in no transport/runtime/native dependency, then requires 90% line coverage per source file |
| `docs` | `cargo doc --no-deps --all-features` with `RUSTDOCFLAGS=-D warnings` |
| `msrv` | reads `rust-version` from the `tinycomputer` package's metadata and builds with exactly that toolchain |
| `supply-chain` | `cargo-deny check all` against `deny.toml` |

Two checks are worth knowing about because they are easy to break by
accident:

- **The contract-crate check.** `crates/tinycomputer-bus` exists so a host can
  depend on the wire types without compiling the module or an async runtime.
  The `rust` job runs `cargo tree -p tinycomputer-bus -e normal,build --prefix
  none` and greps it for `tinybus`, `tokio`, `reqwest`, `ureq`, `hyper`,
  `rusqlite`, `git2`, or `agent-desktop`. A match fails the build. It has to
  be this direction (scoped `-p`, not `-i`) because the inverse form discards
  the `-p` scope and can pass even when `tinycomputer-bus` is the crate at
  fault.
- **Per-file coverage.** `.github/scripts/check-file-coverage.sh` (below)
  enforces 90% line coverage in every source file under `crates/`, not just a
  workspace average.

## .github/workflows/release.yml

A manual `workflow_dispatch` with one input, `bump` (`patch`, `minor`,
`major`, or `current`). Full narrative in the "Releases" section of the
repository's `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`; the short version:

1. **`prepare`** (only runs from `main`) revalidates everything the `ci`
   workflow checks, plus coverage and docs, computes the next version from
   the `tinycomputer` package's current version and the chosen bump, and
   either opens a version-bump pull request (`patch`/`minor`/`major`) or, for
   `current`, tags the already-merged version as `vX.Y.Z` (resuming cleanly
   if that tag already exists, so a partially failed release can be
   re-dispatched).
2. **`native-bundles`** (only for `bump: current`) builds `crates/tinycomputer`
   as a release `cdylib` on a matrix of 12 OS/architecture targets (multiple
   Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows versions), verifies each artifact loads through
   the real TinyBus dynamic loader (`verify_module` from
   `tinycomputer-examples`), bundles it with `LICENSE`, `MODULE.md`, a
   `modules.toml` attestation, and on macOS and Windows the extra helper
   binaries (`agent-desktop-macos-helper`, `tinycomputer-cursor-overlay`)
   those platforms need, then uploads the archive.
3. **`distro-bundles`** does the same inside Fedora 43/44 and Arch Linux
   containers, for hosts that need a distro-native build rather than the
   generic Ubuntu one.
4. **`github-release`** downloads every bundle, expects exactly 16 archives,
   builds a checksum manifest with TinyBus's own `modules checksum` command,
   creates an immutable GitHub release (skipping creation if the tag's
   release already exists, so this step is also safe to resume), and
   verifies the published release by fetching one archive back through
   TinyBus's `github_module_host` example and the local `verify_github_release`
   binary.

The workspace version lives only in `[workspace.package]` in the root
`Cargo.toml`; this workflow owns writing it. Do not hand-edit it.

## .github/scripts/check-file-coverage.sh

Run standalone as `.github/scripts/check-file-coverage.sh [minimum] [report-path]`
(defaults: 90, `coverage.json`). It runs `cargo llvm-cov` across the workspace
(excluding `tinycomputer-examples`) with all features, then filters the JSON
report to files under `crates/` (submodules and `worktrees/` are outside that
prefix and excluded on their own), normalizes LLVM's per-monomorphization line
counts down to unique source lines, prints a per-file table, writes a Markdown
table to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` when running in CI, and exits non-zero listing
every file under the coverage minimum. On macOS it also excludes
`tinycomputer-desktop/src/desktop/clipboard.rs`, because exercising the
clipboard-clear path locally would erase your real pasteboard; Linux CI has no
pasteboard and covers that branch instead.

Run it yourself with a build of `cargo-llvm-cov` installed
(`cargo install cargo-llvm-cov`, or `cargo llvm-cov --version` to check) if
you want the same per-file numbers CI reports.

## .github/dependabot.yml

Two ecosystems, weekly, capped at 5 open pull requests each, patch-level
updates ignored to keep the queue to changes worth reviewing:

- `cargo` (root `/`): minor and patch bumps are grouped into a single weekly
  pull request; anything else (a major bump) arrives as its own PR.
- `github-actions` (root `/`): all matching updates grouped into one weekly
  pull request.

## .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md

The checklist every pull request should fill in: a summary, the related
issue (or "None"), API/behavior changes (or "None"), the validation commands
actually run with their outcome, what tests were added or updated, a
documentation note, and a short checklist (single logical change, no new
`#[allow(...)]`/`#[ignore]`/relaxed lint, no secrets in the diff).

## .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/

Two structured forms and a routing file:

- `bug_report.yml`: version/commit, Rust toolchain, a minimal reproduction,
  expected versus actual behavior, and free-form context. All but context are
  required.
- `feature_request.yml`: the problem or workflow, the proposed solution,
  alternatives considered, and context. Problem and proposal are required.
- `config.yml`: allows blank issues, and adds a contact link that redirects
  security reports to the security policy instead of a public issue.

## Root configuration files

### Cargo.toml

A virtual workspace (`[workspace]`, no root package): every crate lives
under `crates/`, one directory per package, matched by `members =
["crates/*"]`. `vendor` and `worktrees` are explicitly excluded, because both
hold their own nested Cargo manifests that would otherwise look like
duplicate packages to cargo (each vendored submodule is its own workspace,
and each entry under `worktrees/` is a full `git worktree` checkout of this
same repository).

`[workspace.package]` holds the one shared version, edition (`2024`), MSRV
(`1.89`), license (`GPL-3.0-only`), and repository URL every member inherits
with `field.workspace = true`.

`[workspace.dependencies]` is where every shared dependency is declared once,
including the path dependencies into the four vendored submodules described
in [`docs/project/vendor/README.md`](../vendor/README.md); each entry carries
a comment explaining why the crate is needed. `[workspace.lints.rust]` and
`[workspace.lints.clippy]` set the lint levels every crate opts into with
`[lints] workspace = true`, including `unsafe_code = "forbid"`,
`clippy::unwrap_used`, `clippy::expect_used`, `clippy::panic`, and
`clippy::pedantic`, all as CI-fatal warnings. A `[profile.release]` section
sets thin LTO, one codegen unit, and stripped debug info for the shipped
module; a `[profile.dev.package.tinycomputer-cursor]` override keeps the
cursor sprite's supersampling fast in dev builds.

### deny.toml

Configuration for `cargo deny check all`, the same check the `supply-chain`
CI job runs. It fails the build on any dependency with a security advisory
or an unmaintained warning (`[advisories]`, with `ignore = []` so an
exemption needs an explicit, commented entry), restricts accepted licenses to
a fixed allow-list including this workspace's own `GPL-3.0-only`
(`[licenses]`), warns on duplicate dependency versions and denies wildcard
version requirements except for internal path dependencies on unpublished
crates (`[bans]`, with the exemption's reasoning spelled out in a comment),
and restricts crate sources to crates.io plus one explicitly allowed git
source, `tinyhumansai/tinytools`, needed only by the lab's optional LLM
author feature (`[sources]`).

### .env.example

Names and documents every environment variable any crate, test, or example
reads, with a placeholder value or a commented-out example and a one-line
explanation of what it is for. It never holds a real value; `.env` (the file
you copy it to) is git-ignored and must never be committed. Variables cover:

- general Rust logging/backtrace toggles (`RUST_LOG`, `RUST_BACKTRACE`)
- the lab (`scripts/lab`): `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `TINYCOMPUTER_LAB_MODEL`,
  `TINYCOMPUTER_LAB_SELF_EMAIL`, `TINYCOMPUTER_LAB_JEV_MODEL`,
  `TINYCOMPUTER_MODULE`
- the Jev debug journal: `TINYCOMPUTER_JEV_JOURNAL`
- flow and deliberation strategy: `TINYCOMPUTER_FLOW_STRATEGY`,
  `TINYCOMPUTER_FLOW_DELIBERATION`
- browser perception and launch: `TINYCOMPUTER_BROWSER_PERCEPTION`,
  `TINYCOMPUTER_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE`, `TINYCOMPUTER_BROWSER_ARGS`,
  `TINYCOMPUTER_BROWSER_USER_AGENT`, `TINYCOMPUTER_BROWSER_ENDPOINT`,
  `TINYCOMPUTER_FIXTURE_URL`
- the cursor overlay helper: `TINYCOMPUTER_CURSOR_OVERLAY`
- the task planner and rescues: `TINYCOMPUTER_PLANNER_MODEL`,
  `TINYCOMPUTER_RESCUE_MODEL`, `TASK_RESCUES`
- opting into live browser runs: `TINYCOMPUTER_LIVE_BROWSER`

If you add a new environment variable anywhere in the workspace, add it here
too, in the same commit, with a placeholder rather than a real value.

### rust-toolchain

There is no pinned `rust-toolchain`/`rust-toolchain.toml` file in this
repository. CI installs `stable` (and, for the `msrv` job, whatever version
`rust-version` in `[workspace.package]` names) with `dtolnay/rust-toolchain`;
locally you're expected to have a recent stable toolchain that satisfies that
same MSRV.
